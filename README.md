#### **Installation**:

  
**Launch Joplin desktop application:**

Make sure that Joplin is using the dark mode in Tools > Options > Appearance  
Go to “Tools > Options > Appearance > Show Advanced Settings”. Paste the content of userstyle.css in the file opened by clicking on the button “Custom stylesheet for rendered Markdown”  paste the content of userchrome.css in the file opened by clicking on the button “Custom stylesheet for Joplin wide-app styles”.   
  
Alternatively, you can also clone this repository and create symbolic links to userchrome.css and userstyle.css inside Joplin configuration folder (e.g. in ~/.config/joplin-desktop on Linux).
